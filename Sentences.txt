The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

A stitch in time saves nine

Actions speak louder than words

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder

Don't count your chickens before they hatch

Every cloud has a silver lining

The early bird catches the worm

Practice makes perfect

When life gives you lemons make lemonade

Fortune favors the bold

All's fair in love and war

Time heals all wounds

Slow and steady wins the race

Opportunity seldom knocks twice

Actions speak louder than words

The pen is mightier than the sword

Honesty is the best policy

Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans

Where there's a will, there's a way

Laughter is the best medicine

The only constant in life is change
